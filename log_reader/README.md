# Log Reader

A log processor used to read TGStation-based logs and extract whatever string you'd like for them. Default is to search for `uplink.log` files and extract how often uplink items are bought.

## Steps for use
- Set `output_location` to `outputfile.txt`
- Place script in the logs folder, ideally as high up as possible (in the per-year logs is best to search all of them in minimal time)
- Run script
